# Dailies Server

When you take on a daily practice you need to remove as much friction from
your process as possible to help ensure you keep up that practice. For visual
artists or influencers taking on the practice of posting to Instagram everyday,
downloading the image and caption to your phone and posting it takes a while.
Airdrop is a great way to get files from your computer to your phone, but it
takes to long and you might not have a Mac in the first place. Enter Dailies
Server.
